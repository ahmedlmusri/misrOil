IMPORTANT: HOW TO ADD THE VIDEO BACKGROUND

The website code is ready and waiting for your video!

1. Download a video you like (MP4 format).
2. Rename the file to: hero_video.mp4
3. Drag and drop it into this folder.

Once you do that, the Hero section will automatically play the video instead of the image.
